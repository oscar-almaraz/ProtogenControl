Protogen Control

It's a mobile Xamarin App built to control your Protogen Head via Bluetooth.

We plan to add compatibility via Wifi and integration with Azure IOT.

This is a project I'm doing for a friend where I want to experiment with Azure IOT, to understand how I can push Firmware directly to a device from the cloud.
